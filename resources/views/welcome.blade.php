                I'm a programmer with experience scripting in Python, and Web Development, setting my sights on more opportunities to be trained while I work as experience and knowledge are my top priorities.

                I have experience in:

                Scripting and implementing of HMI's in Ignition 7/8 SCADA platform, as well as exposure to Kepware and Cygnet; exposure to cloud services: AWS Beanstalk, EC2, S3, and DB management tools (MS SQL Server, Azure)

                Basic Web Development (Laravel, jQuery, Bootstrap, MySQL), Git version control, and Atlassian project management tools.

                my next milestone would be to become a full-stack software developer with knowledge in control systems, eventually leading to a career in Systems Engineering.
